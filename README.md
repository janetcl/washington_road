# washington_road
Final project for COS 426: Computer Graphics. A Princeton variation of the popular game Crossy Road, using Washington Road as inspiration.

We used the starter code from https://codepen.io/HunorMarton/full/JwWLJo to build off of the basic version of Crossy Road. The original code is found in game-starter-code.js, and you can see the updated game code in game.js, which includes our additions as commented with "// WASHINGTON ROAD:".
